# neural-networks


Here I've implemented a (somewhat inefficient) multilayer feedforward network from scratch for both classification and regression, along with an auto-encoder to compare performance between different model types

Full writeup and discussion of results is in the [Writep and Results.pdf](/Neural_Networks_Writeup.pdf) file.

The datasets used are in the datasets folder. These are public datasets available from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/index.php).

One ipynb is provided as to how the results were calculated (through various Jupyter Notebooks), which is of the Abalone dataset.
